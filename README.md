I'm a Computer Science student at UVA who enjoys building impactful software.

Lately I’ve been working on [FloodWatch.io](https://floodwatch.io) — a platform improving flood risk warning across Vietnam — and [theCourseForum](https://thecourseforum.com) - a course review platform assisting in course selection for UVA students.

I’ve interned at **Appian** and **Ellucian**, where I worked on scalable backend systems, AI-powered features, and internal developer tools.

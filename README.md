# 👋 I'm Phong 

![rainbowline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25073ce0-cd58-48f5-9adf-691250d350df)

I'm a Computer Science student at UVA who passionate about impactful software.

Lately I’ve been working on [FloodWatch.io](https://floodwatch.io) (a platform improving flood risk warning across Vietnam) and [theCourseForum](https://thecourseforum.com) (a course review platform assisting in course selection for UVA students).

I’ve interned at **Appian** and **Ellucian**, where I worked on scalable backend systems, AI-powered features, and internal developer tools.
